Overview,Overview,"The RTP Performance Dashboard is a resource to help the region understand how well it is meeting long range goals and desired outcomes identified in the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). At a minimum, the Dashboard will be updated each fall as various Census and other Transportation related data sources are released. Metrics on the Dashboard are focused on topic areas that were identified by the Transportation Policy Board as high priorities for the region during development of the RTP."
Safety,Overview,"Safety was one of the key policy focus areas identified by PSRC’s Transportation Policy Board early in the development of the RTP. Safety impacts every aspect of the transportation system, covering all modes and encompassing a variety of attributes from facility design to security to personal behavior. PSRC and numerous jurisdictions around the region are working to develop plans and implement projects following FHWA's Safe System Approach, which recognizes that humans make mistakes; mitigates the impact when crashes do occur; and protects the most vulnerable users of the system."
Safety,Geography-Regional,"The total number of crashes that resulted in fatalities and serious injuries in the Puget Sound region between 2010 and 2022 are shown below. After a decrease in the early part of the decade, there has been a significant increase in traffic related deaths in the past three years. In 2022, traffic related deaths averaged almost 1 per day in the region."
Safety,Geography-HDC,"Total collisions in Historically Disadvantaged Communities have been increasing in similar ways to the region as a whole. A ""Historically Disadvantaged Community"" is defined by the Justice40 Interim Guidance Addendum, issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and Climate Policy Office (CPO) as any Census Tract identified as a community that has been marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution or any Federally Recognized Tribe or Tribal entity, whether or not they have land."
Safety,Geography-County,Trends in Fatal collisions vary across the region's counties. Pierce county has the highest fatal collision rate in the Puget Sound region.
Safety,Geography-MPO,"The Puget Sound region had the seventh lowest fatal accident rate per 100,000 people in 2021 among the 27 largest MPO regions."
Safety,Demographics-Race,Total fatal collisions vary by race with the rate for American Indian & Alaskan Native peoples almost 7 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. 
Safety,Demographics-Age,Younger people between the age of 18 and 30 had the highest rate of both serious and fata collisions in 2022.
Safety,Demographics-Gender,Total fatal and serious collisions vary by gender with men four times more likely to be in a fatal collision than women.
Safety,Other-Mode,"Fatal and serious injury collisions have been increasing for all modes with large increases in deaths for people walking and biking. 79 people walking died in 2022, more than double the number of people killed walking in 2010 (36)"
Safety,Other-Roadway,More than 3/4's of all traffic related deaths occurred on an arterial in 2022.
Safety,Other-Time,"Despite carrying less than half of the volume of daytime travel, there are more traffic related deaths and equal serious injuries after 6pm."
Safety,Other-Day,Friday and Saturday account for almost half of all traffic related deaths in any given week.
Climate,Overview,"Climate change is a primary focus of VISION 2050 and the RTP, with a goal for the region to substantially reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change in accordance with the goals of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (50% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050) as well as to prepare for climate change impacts.  The region's Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy focuses on reducing emissions within the categories of Land Use, Transportation Choices, Pricing and Technology."
Climate,ZEV-Regional,"Decarbonization of the transportation fleet is an important part of the Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy. In 2023, almost 1/4 of all new vehicle registrations in the region have been electric or plug-in electric vehicles."
Climate,ZEV-Tracts,"Electric vehicle registrations are all the across the Puget Sound Region but some of the highest levels of market penetration are in the Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond area. There are noticeable areas in Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties that have lower ZEV registration levels and they tend to overlap with areas of lower incomes."
Climate,VMT-Regional,"Vehicle miles traveled peaked in the late 1990’s at around 24 miles per person per day. In 2018, the average miles driven per person had reduced to about 21 miles per day. Over the next thirty years, the average miles driven per capita is forecasted to reduce even further to approximately 18 miles per day per person."
Climate,VMT-County,"Vehicle miles driven vary greatly across the region as well as by equity focus areas. For example, even though the average resident of the region travels almost 18 miles per day in 2050, people of lower incomes travel about 15 miles per day and people living in regional growth centers travel around 7 miles per day."
Climate,VMT-Global,"Under VISION 2050, a significant amount of the growth between 2018 and 2050 is focused in regional growth centers and near high-capacity transit stations. The majority of these areas are located in the VISION 2050 regional geographies of Metropolitan Cities, Core Cities and High-Capacity Transit Communities, the most urbanized and densely developed parts of the region. As shown below, driving in these places is more like many European countries than to other parts of the United States by 2050."
Climate,WFH-County,"In 2022, approximately 18% of people worked from home in the Central Puget Sound region, up from 5% in 2012. King County had the highest share of work from home rates at 18%, reflective of the higher share of technology workers. Pierce County has a work from home rate 1/2 of King County."
Climate,WFH-Race,"There are notable differences in work-from-home rates by Race & Ethnicity, reflective of the types of employment by race. In general work from home rates for white and Asian residents was double that of Black workers. In 2022, almost 30% of Asian workers worked from home while 14% of Hispanic workers did."
Climate,WFH-Metro,"The Seattle area had similar work from home rates of other major metro areas with large tech influences such as Austin, Denver, Washington DC and the Bay Area."
Climate,WFH-City,Many cities east of Lake Washington had some of the highest work from home rates in 2022.
Growth,Overview,"To support thriving communities, a strong economy and a healthy environment, VISION 2050 and the Regional Growth Strategy calls for 65% of the region's population growth and 75% of the region's job growth be located in regional growth centers and near existing and planned high-capacity transit."
Growth,Population-Regional,"VISION 2050 plans for 5.8 million people to live in our region by 2050, adding about 50,000 per year between 2018 and 2050. Over those same 30 years, the central Puget Sound region is also planning to add another million jobs, with a jobs forecast of 3.3 million jobs by 2050 and an annual job change of nearly 33,000 jobs per year. Observed population growth is tracking very closely to these forecasts. After dramatic job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, by the end of 2022 the region's job base had grown back to 2019 levels, but over 100,000 jobs fewer than forecast. To house future growth, the region needs to more than 800,000 new housing units, approximately 28,000 new housing units per year. The region added a total of just under 30,000 new housing units between 2022 and 2023, on track with forecasts."
Growth,Population-HCT,"In VISION 2050, the goal for growth between 2018 and 2050 is 65% of population growth and 75% of job growth to occur near high-capacity transit. In 2023, approximately 50% of population growth and 57% of new housing units were within close proximity to high-capacity transit. In 2022, about 57% of job growth was in high-capacity transit areas."
Transit,Overview,"VISION 2050 and the Regional Transportation Plan envision an integrated multimodal system that supports local and regional growth centers and high-capacity transit station areas. The RTP includes significant investment in local and regional transit; for example, by 2050 the region is anticipated to have 36 bus rapid transit routes, 10 passenger only ferry routes, and 116 miles of light rail."
Transit,Metrics-Region,"Regional transit boardings, revenue-hours and boardings per hour"
Transit,Metrics-Mode,"Year to date Regional transit boardings in 2023 have continued to recover from pandemic level lows but recovery has varied by mode. Rail (including Link light rail and Seattle's streetcar and monorail services) and Ferry modes are closest to pre-pandemic levels. Commuter Rail and Vanpools, which are highly dependent on workers in major employment centers, continue to recover at slower rates."
Transit,Metrics-MPO,"Transit recovery from the pandemic has varied across the country. At the end of August 2023, year to date transit boardings in the PSRC region were approximately 66% of pre-pandemic levels, similar to Boston, Washington DC and Sacramento. "
Transit,Mode-County,Transit mode share in 2022 was down from pre-pandemic levels due to work from home tendencies for office workers. King County had the highest transit mode share for work trips in 2022.
Transit,Mode-Race,"People of color tend to use transit more as a commute share than white commuters. In 2022, African American workers had the highest rate of transit use in the region at approximately 12% - almost twice the rate for white workers."
Transit,Mode-City,"Bainbridge Island, with its dependency on the Washington State Ferries for connections to major employment centers east of Puget Sound,  had the highest share of workers who commute via transit in 2022 followed by the City of Seattle."
Transit,Mode-Metro,"Despite a global pandemic, transit commute share for the Seattle Metro region ranked the 8th highest of all major metro areas in 2022. "
Modes,Overview,"The Regional Transportation Plan recognizes active transportation, such as walking or cycling, as an essential element of the region’s transportation system. The region’s existing sidewalks, bicycle facilities and trails provide vital connections to transit and other local and regional destinations. However, there are substantial gaps in the facility network, leaving people unable  to walk and bicycle to their destinations in some areas, particularly in less urban areas."
Modes,Walk-County,"In 2021, approximately 5.4% of people walk to work in Kitsap County, the highest commute walk share in the region."
Modes,Walk-Race,People tend to walk to work at similar levels by Race & Ethnicity.
Modes,Walk-Metro,"The Seattle are had one of the highest walk to work shares of any major metro in 2021, trailing only Boston and New York City."
Modes,Walk-City,"The City of Bremerton, with many workers at Naval Station Bremerton living near the base, had the highest share of workers who walked to work in 2021 followed by the City of Seattle."
Modes,Bike-County,"In 2021, approximately 1.0% of people biked to work in the Central Puget Sound region. King County had slightly higher bike shares than the other counties in the four county region."
Modes,Bike-Race,"Due to the small sample size associated with biking to work, several data points are lacking sufficient data to highlight differences. "
Modes,Bike-Metro,The Seattle are had similar bike to work levels as Boston and New York City. Portland Oregon is the only large metro region in the country to have a bike to work share over 2%
Modes,Bike-City,The City of Seattle has a bike to work share close to 3%.
Travel-Times,Overview,"Strategic investments, combined with an increasing set of travel options, help to minimize the overall level of congestion growth in the region. Although the overall amount of delay for all vehicle modes if forecasted to increases between 2018 and 2050 , growth in congestion per household is estimated to be approximately 7% lower in 2050 than it was in 2018."
Travel-Times,TT-County,"In 2021, King County had the lowest average commute time to work at approximately 29 minutes."
Travel-Times,TT-Race,There are not noticeable differences in travel time to work by Race & Ethnicity with most average approximately 30 minutes per day.
Travel-Times,TT-Metro,The Seattle area ranked #9 for the most people with a commute of at least an hour in 2021.
Travel-Times,DT-Region,"In 2021 almost 40% or workers departed for work in the AM Peak (7am to 9am) followed by 29% of workers leaving for work in the Early Morning (5am to 7am). In all, 68% of all workers departed for work in the morning."
