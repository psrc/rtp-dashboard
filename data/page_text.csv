Safety,Overview,"Safety was one of the key policy focus areas identified by PSRC’s Transportation Policy Board early in the development of the RTP. Safety impacts every aspect of the transportation system, covering all modes and encompassing a variety of attributes from facility design to security to personal behavior. Many organizations and jurisdictions have implemented programs and projects aimed at improving safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries. All seek to achieve the long-term goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries."
Safety,Geography-Regional,"The total number of crashes that resulted in fatalities in the Puget Sound region between 2010 and 2022 are shown below. After a decrease in the early part of the decade, there has been a significant increase in traffic related deaths in the past three years. In 2022, traffic related deaths averaged almost 1 per day in the region."

Safety,Geography-MPO,"The Puget Sound region had the fifth lowest fatal accident rate per 100,000 people in 2020 among the 27 largest MPO regions. Some the regions with rates lower than the PSRC region include New York and Boston. One region similar is size to PSRC with one of the lowest rates are the Twin Cities. The highest fatality rates amongst MPO regions are in Florida."

Climate,Overview,"Climate change is a primary focus of VISION 2050 and the RTP, with a goal for the region to substantially reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change in accordance with the goals of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (50% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050) as well as to prepare for climate change impacts."
Climate,ZEV-Regional,"Decarbonization of the transporation fleet is an important part of the Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy. In 2023, almost 1/4 of all new vehicle registrations in the region have been electric or plug-in electric vehicles."
Climate,ZEV-Zipcode,"Electric vehicle registrations are all the across the Puget Sound Region but some of the highest levels of market penetration are in the Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond area. There are noticable areas in Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties that have lower ZEV registration levels and they tend to overlap with areas of lower incomes."
