Overview,Overview,"The RTP Performance Dashboard is a resource to help the region understand how well it is meeting it's long range goals. At a minimum, the dashboard will be updated each fall as various Census and Transportation related metrics are released. Metrics on the dashboard are focused on topic areas that were identified by the Transportation Policy Board as high priorities for the region"
Safety,Overview,"Safety was one of the key policy focus areas identified by PSRC’s Transportation Policy Board early in the development of the RTP. Safety impacts every aspect of the transportation system, covering all modes and encompassing a variety of attributes from facility design to security to personal behavior. Many organizations and jurisdictions have implemented programs and projects aimed at improving safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries. All seek to achieve the long-term goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries."
Safety,Geography-Regional,"The total number of crashes that resulted in fatalities in the Puget Sound region between 2010 and 2022 are shown below. After a decrease in the early part of the decade, there has been a significant increase in traffic related deaths in the past three years. In 2022, traffic related deaths averaged almost 1 per day in the region."
Safety,Geography-HDC,Total collisions by Historically Disadvantaged Communities
Safety,Geography-County,Trends in Fatal collisions vary across the region's counties.
Safety,Geography-MPO,"The Puget Sound region had the fifth lowest fatal accident rate per 100,000 people in 2020 among the 27 largest MPO regions. Some the regions with rates lower than the PSRC region include New York and Boston. One region similar is size to PSRC with one of the lowest rates are the Twin Cities. The highest fatality rates amongst MPO regions are in Florida."

Climate,Overview,"Climate change is a primary focus of VISION 2050 and the RTP, with a goal for the region to substantially reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change in accordance with the goals of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (50% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050) as well as to prepare for climate change impacts."
Climate,ZEV-Regional,"Decarbonization of the transportation fleet is an important part of the Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy. In 2023, almost 1/4 of all new vehicle registrations in the region have been electric or plug-in electric vehicles."
Climate,ZEV-Tracts,"Electric vehicle registrations are all the across the Puget Sound Region but some of the highest levels of market penetration are in the Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond area. There are noticeable areas in Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties that have lower ZEV registration levels and they tend to overlap with areas of lower incomes."
Climate,VMT-Regional,"Vehicle miles traveled peaked in the late 1990’s at around 24 miles per person per day. In 2018, the average miles driven per day had reduced to about 21 miles per day. Over the next thirty years, the average distance driven per capita is forecasted to reduce even further to approximately 18 miles per day per person, helping the region to contribute to goals of reducing VMT per capita."
Climate,VMT-County,"Vehicle miles driven vary greatly across the region as well as by equity focus areas. For example, even though the average resident of the region travels almost 18 miles per day in 2050, people of lower incomes travel about 15 miles per day and people living in regional growth centers travel around 7 miles per day."
Climate,VMT-Global,"Under VISION 2050, growth between 2018 and 2050 is focused near high-capacity transit stations. The majority of these investments are located in the VISION 2050 regional geographies of Metropolitan Cities, Core Cities and High-Capacity Transit Communities, the most urbanized and densely developed parts of the region. As shown below, driving in these places is more like many European countries than to other parts of the United States by 2050."
Growth,Overview,"Over the next 30 years, the central Puget Sound region will add another million and a half people, reaching a population of 5.8 million. How can we ensure that all residents benefit from the region’s thriving communities, strong economy and healthy environment as population grows? Local counties, cities, Tribes and other partners have worked together with PSRC to develop VISION 2050. The region's vision for 2050 is to provide exceptional quality of life, opportunity for all, connected communities, a spectacular natural environment, and an innovative, thriving economy."
Growth,Population-Regional,"VISION 2050 plans for 5.8 million people to live in our region by 2050, adding about 50,000 per year between 2018 and 2050. Over those same 30 years, the central Puget Sound region is also planning to add another million jobs, with a jobs forecast of 3.3 million jobs by 2050 and an annual job change of nearly 33,000 jobs per year. To house this future growth, the region needs to more than 800,000 new housing units, approximately 28,000 new housing units per year."
Growth,Population-HCT,"In VISION 2050, the goal for growth between 2018 and 2050 is 65% of population growth and 75% of job growth to occur near high-capacity transit."
Transit,Overview,"The Regional Transportation Plan envisions an integrated system that supports the goals of VISION 2050, which calls for increased investment in transportation to support a growing population and economy. VISION 2050 emphasizes investing in transportation projects and programs that support local and regional growth centers and high-capacity transit station areas in particular. These policies emphasize the importance of public transit to achieving the VISION 2050 regional growth strategy."
Transit,Metrics-Region,"Regional transit boardings, revenue-hours and boardings per hour"
Transit,Metrics-Mode,"Year to date Regional transit boardings in 2023 have continued to recover from pandemic level lows but recovery has varied by mode. Light Rail and Ferry modes are closest to pre-pandemic levels, with rail eclipsing 2019 year to date boardings at the end of August 2023. Commuter Rail and Vanpools, which are highly dependent on workers in major employment centers, continue to recover at slower rates."
Transit,Metrics-MPO,"Transit recovery from the Pandemic has varied across the country. At the end of August 2023, year to date transit boardings in the PSRC region were approximately 67% of pre-pandemic levels, similar to Boston, Washington DC and Sacramento. Metro regions like Tampa, Austin and San Diego have recovered to approximately 80% of per-covid levels. The Miami region was 90% of pre-covid levels at the end of August. Transit usage in the Phoenix area has recovered the least of the 27 largest metro regions with about 48% pre-covid levels of transit boardings."
Transit,Mode-County,Transit mode share in 2021 was down from pre-pandemic levels due to work from home tendencies for office workers. King County had the highest transit mode share for work trips in 2021.
Transit,Mode-Race,"People of color tend to use transit more as a commute share than white commuters. In 2021, African American workers had the highest rate of transit use in the region at approximately 12% - almost twice the rate for white workers."
Transit,Mode-City,"Bainbridge Island, with its dependency on the Washington State Ferries for connections to major employment centers east of the Salish Sea,  had the highest share of workers who commute via transit in 2021 followed by the City of Seattle."
Transit,Mode-Metro,"Despite a global pandemic, transit commute share for the Seattle Metro region ranked the 8th highest of all major metro areas in 2021. "
Modes,Overview,"The Regional Transportation Plan recognizes active transportation, such as walking or cycling, as an essential element of the region’s transportation system. The region’s existing sidewalks, bicycle facilities and trails provide vital connections to transit and other local and regional destinations. However, there are substantial gaps in the facility network, leaving people unable  to walk and bicycle to their destinations in some areas, particularly in less urban areas."
Modes,Walk-County,"In 2021, approximately 5.4% of people walk to work in Kitsap County, the highest commute walk share in the region."
Modes,Walk-Race,People tend to walk to work at similar levels by Race & Ethnicity.
Modes,Walk-Metro,"The Seattle are had one of the highest walk to work shares of any major metro in 2021, trailing only Boston and New York City."
Modes,Walk-City,"The City of Bremerton, with many workers at Naval Station Bremerton living near the base, had the highest share of workers who walked to work in 2021 followed by the City of Seattle."
Modes,Bike-County,"In 2021, approximately 1.0% of people biked to work in the Central Puget Sound region. King County had slightly higher bike shares than the other counties in the four county region."
Modes,Bike-Race,"Due to the small sample size associated with biking to work, several data points are lacking sufficient data to highlight differences. "
Modes,Bike-Metro,The Seattle are had similar bike to work levels as Boston and New York City. Portland Oregon is the only large metro region in the country to have a bike to work share over 2%
Modes,Bike-City,The City of Seattle has a bike to work share close to 3%.
