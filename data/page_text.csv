Safety,Overview,"Safety was one of the key policy focus areas identified by PSRC’s Transportation Policy Board early in the development of the RTP. Safety impacts every aspect of the transportation system, covering all modes and encompassing a variety of attributes from facility design to security to personal behavior. Many organizations and jurisdictions have implemented programs and projects aimed at improving safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries. All seek to achieve the long-term goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries."
Safety,Geography-Regional,"The total number of crashes that resulted in fatalities in the Puget Sound region between 2010 and 2022 are shown below. After a decrease in the early part of the decade, there has been a significant increase in traffic related deaths in the past three years. In 2022, traffic related deaths averaged almost 1 per day in the region."

Safety,Geography-MPO,"The Puget Sound region had the fifth lowest fatal accident rate per 100,000 people in 2020 among the 27 largest MPO regions. Some the regions with rates lower than the PSRC region include New York and Boston. One region similar is size to PSRC with one of the lowest rates are the Twin Cities. The highest fatality rates amongst MPO regions are in Florida."

Climate,Overview,"Climate change is a primary focus of VISION 2050 and the RTP, with a goal for the region to substantially reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change in accordance with the goals of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (50% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050) as well as to prepare for climate change impacts."
Climate,ZEV-Regional,"Decarbonization of the transporation fleet is an important part of the Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy. In 2023, almost 1/4 of all new vehicle registrations in the region have been electric or plug-in electric vehicles."
Climate,ZEV-Zipcode,"Electric vehicle registrations are all the across the Puget Sound Region but some of the highest levels of market penetration are in the Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond area. There are noticable areas in Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties that have lower ZEV registration levels and they tend to overlap with areas of lower incomes."
Climate,VMT-Regional,"Vehicle miles traveled peaked in the late 1990’s at around 24 miles per person per day. In 2018, the average miles driven per day had reduced to about 21 miles per day. Over the next thirty years, the average distance driven per capita is forecasted to reduce even further to approximately 18 miles per day per person, helping the region to contribute to goals of reducing VMT per capita."
Climate,VMT-County,"Vehicle miles driven vary greatly across the region as well as by equity focus areas. For example, even though the average resident of the region travels almost 18 miles per day in 2050, people of lower incomes travel about 15 miles per day and people living in regional growth centers travel around 7 miles per day."
Climate,VMT-Global,"Under VISION 2050, growth between 2018 and 2050 is focused near high-capacity transit stations. The majority of these investments are located in the VISION 2050 regional geographies of Metropolitan Cities, Core Cities and High-Capacity Transit Communities, the most urbanized and densely developed parts of the region. As shown below, driving in these places is more like many European countries than to other parts of the United States by 2050."
