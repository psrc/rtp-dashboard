Safety,Overview,"Safety was one of the key policy focus areas identified by PSRC’s Transportation Policy Board early in the development of the RTP and is a cross-cutting issue addressed throughout all relevant sections of the plan. Safety impacts every aspect of the transportation system, covering all modes and encompassing a variety of attributes from facility design to security to personal behavior. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) refers to the Four E’s of safety: engineering, enforcement, education and emergency medical services. Many organizations and jurisdictions have implemented programs and projects aimed at improving safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries. All seek to achieve the long-term goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries."
