Data for the dashboard must be copied from a local source to folder on the shiny server for the dashboard to work. 
We do not store the input files on GitHub. 

The following can be run from the host machine to copy to the internal server (check the folder locations):

scp -r X:/DSA/shiny-uploads/rtp-dashboard/data/*  shiny@aws-linux:~/apps/rtp-dashboard/data/
