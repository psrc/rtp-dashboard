strategies to increase transit and rideshare ridership based on a deeper, more holistic
understanding of a changing transit market in a post COVID-19 pandemic society. It will
increase and extend existing Metro TDM programs and apply new, innovative strategies. The
project will focus on 24 designated Regional Growth and MIC Centers in both King and
Snohomish counties which are connected by 17 high-capacity transit corridors with existing
service, and upcoming new services starting between 2024 and 2027 alongside parallel
transit feeder service restructures in both counties."

property at its South Campus in Tukwila to create a new transit base. The new base will
increase Metro’s base capacity to support the expansion of Metro’s bus fleet by
approximately 250 new 100% electric buses. The additional base capacity will allow Metro to
provide additional transit service as all of its existing bases are at or beyond capacity and
unable to accommodate additional buses to increase service. The SAB will also create base
capacity that will allow Metro to upgrade its other six operating bases to support a fully electric
bus fleet of over approximately 1,361 buses by 2035 while maintain transit service that
operates out of these bases."
CMAQ,5,Northwest Seaport Alliance, Zero-Emission Cargo-Handling Equipment Incentive Program,4400000,Other,Manufacturing / Industrial Center,No,3,6,8,1,28,10,2,58,"The Zero-Emission Cargo-Handling Equipment Incentive Program will support the tenants of
the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA) to retire their diesel equipment early and replace
them with zero-emission (battery-electric or hydrogen) equivalent units. The program will help
the NWSA and its tenants meet the goals of the Northwest Ports Clean Air Strategy,
eliminating all seaport-related emissions by 2050. Cargo-handling equipment (CHE) is a
priority activity sector to target in the near-term, as equipment stays on the terminal for its
entire lifetime, meaning near-port communities in the Seattle and Tacoma Harbors are living
side-by-side with these resulting diesel exhaust emissions."

Stream 1 BRT corridor, will focus on the construction of transit priority lanes and multimodal
access to transit through the interchange with SR 512, the most congested portion of the
BRT corridor. The project’s limits from 112th Street S to 99th Street S (0.81 miles or 6 percent
of the corridor length) will span the most congested section of Pacific Avenue within the
Stream 1 BRT corridor but represent approximately half of the projected total transit travel
